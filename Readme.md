# Intro

CT Crypto Lite was a lightweight cross-platform mobile app for crypto investment simulation built on React Native with Expo framework.

The app was published in early 2021 and unpublished in late 2022.
It had about 100 users from AppStore and Google Play combined.

The code was no longer maintained due to lack of time, and I decided to archive it.
